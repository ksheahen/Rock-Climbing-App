# Backend

TBD - Details on how to start backend

## Folder Structure

Like the frontend, we may not need all these folders. It's merely a starting point for us

- `app/`: Main backend application code
- `api/`: API logic, endpoints, and routing
- `middleware/`: Functions that process requests/responses before reaching routes
- `routes/`: Route definitions for handling API requests
- `models/`: Database models and schema definitions
- `services/`: Business logic and external service integrations
- `utils/`: General-purpose helper functions
- `tests/`: Test code for backend modules
